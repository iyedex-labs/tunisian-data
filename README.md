# 🇹🇳 TUNISIAN DATA HUB

## THE OPEN NATIONAL DATASET FOR ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE

Tunisian Data Hub is a massive, high-granularity digital library created and licensed by **IyedeX**. This repository is the foundational training ground for **3amAli** and any future Tunisian AI models. It is designed to be the "Wikipedia of Tunisian Data"—open for the community to enrich, refine, and expand.

## PROJECT CORE ARCHITECTURE

The structure is optimized for **Large Language Models (LLMs)**. By separating data into many specific folders, we allow AI to learn context, humor, professional tone, and factual accuracy independently.

| LAYER | FOCUS | OBJECTIVE |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **01 LINGUISTICS** | Darja & Chat | Natural flow and conversational intelligence |
| **02 ENTERTAINMENT** | Jokes & Media | Sarcasm, humor, and cultural wit |
| **03 WISDOM** | Proverbs & Quotes | Traditional values and metaphorical reasoning |
| **04 BUSINESS** | Enterprise & Law | Professional assistance and economic logic |
| **05 FACTUAL** | History & Places | Grounded truth and national knowledge |
